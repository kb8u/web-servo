An extremely simple web interface for controlling a servo on a Raspberry Pi
with no error checking or security whatsover.

Rough installation notes:
git clone https://github.com/richardghirst/PiBits.git
cd PiBits/ServoBlaster
sudo make
sudo make install

#change the OPTS parameters in this repo servoblaster file to match your servo
sudo cp servoblaster /etc/init.d/servoblaster

sudo apt-get install apache2
sudo a2enmod cgid

#edit this repo index.html and change the title to whatever you want
#change the stepsize to match /etc/init.d/servoblaster
cp index.html vario.css /var/www/html

sudo cp servo.sh /usr/lib/cgi-bin/servo.sh

sudo apache2ctl restart

#find the Pi IP address with hostname -I
#the web page is as that IP address.  https won't work at this point, use http.
#move the slider to move the servo...
